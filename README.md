# StonkSight

**StonkSight** is a work-in-progress project to visualize stock data and predict future stock values using machine learning techniques. It aims to offer users insights into financial markets by combining historical data, statistical analysis, and predictive modelling.

## Features

* Fetch and display historical stock data (price, volume, etc.)
* Data preprocessing & cleaning
* Machine learning model(s) to predict future stock prices
* Visualization of predictions vs actual data
* Modular structure to allow swapping of models and data sources

## Architecture

Here’s a high-level overview of how StonkSight is organized:

| Component             | Responsibility                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `app.py`              | Main application entry point; handles user interaction / input & output. |
| `models/`             | Directory for ML models: training, saving, loading.                      |
| Data ingestion module | (future) fetch stock data from sources (e.g. APIs) and preprocess.       |
| Visualization module  | (future) graphs & charts for analysis and prediction results.            |

## Installation

These steps assume you're working in a Python environment (3.8+).

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Martipetti/StonkSight.git
   cd StonkSight
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # on macOS/Linux
   .\venv\Scripts\activate     # on Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *If `requirements.txt` does not exist yet, dependencies might include things like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, etc.*

4. (Optional) Download or prepare any model files / data needed (if provided).

## Usage

An example of how to run the application and predict stock values:

```bash
python app.py --ticker AAPL --start-date 2022-01-01 --end-date 2025-01-01
```

This would fetch historical data for ticker `AAPL` between the given dates, process it, run prediction, and (possibly) display or save results.

*Note: actual CLI flags / parameters may differ depending on the current implementation.*

## Modeling

* Current ML method(s) used (e.g. linear regression, decision trees, neural networks)
* How data is split: training vs validation vs test
* Performance metrics being tracked (e.g. MSE, MAE, R²)
* How model artifacts are stored (paths, formats)

## Development

If you want to contribute or extend the project:

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a **new branch** for your feature/fix
3. Write code & tests
4. Open a **Pull Request**, describing your changes

Useful things to consider:

* Maintain modularity: isolate data ingestion, preprocessing, modeling, visualization
* Write clear documentation / docstrings
* Ensure reproducibility (random seeds, versioning, etc.)

## Roadmap

Here are some planned enhancements / features:

* Support for multiple data sources (APIs, CSVs, financial databases)
* More advanced ML / deep learning models (LSTM, Transformer, etc.)
* Hyperparameter tuning
* Interactive dashboards (e.g. via web frontend or notebook)
* Real-time or streaming data support
* Backtesting strategies based on predictions


## Contributing

* Feel free to open issues if you find bugs, or have feature suggestions
* Pull requests are welcome; try to follow the existing style/layout
* Provide tests where relevant
* Document your changes
